## Overview
Create a non transferable NFT that will allow users access to our application deployed on Streamlit Cloud. The application will provide a dashboard that users can interact with displaying useful day trading metrics and a forecast of asset prices. We will provide access to DOW 30 but can expand in the future if we decide to. We will collect the end users activity in the application and save activity to a SQL database for the purpose of future development and user behavior/activity research.

## Goals
- Create a purposeful dashboard that will:

- Forecast the daily closing price using time series models (example but not limited to Prophet and ARIMA)
- Forecast the trend using a model ( Neural Network for example ) Using blockchain technology, create a non transferable NFT that will allow users secure access to our platform.(ERC1155 Standards, also known as “Semi-Fungible Token”) Create mechanism for Minting NFT’s and/or transferring ownership to users wallet Deploy platform using Streamlit Cloud
##Technologies used: 
- Streamlit (Dashboard) Dark Mode 
- Streamlit Cloud (Deploy) 
- Pandas (Dataframes) 
- Blockchain / NFT 3rd web - prebuilt contracts Solidity (maybe) 
- SQL (cloud)
